# Trading Journal — 2025-05-07

## Emotional State:
- Premarket: Focused, aligned with plan
- Intraday: Slight FOMO midday, quickly reset
- EOD: Satisfied with risk control on FOMC day

## Observations:
- Good job waiting for 2:30pm per DP/Mancini guidance
- Did not chase early flushes or fakeouts
- Clear setup on QQQ puts, but trimmed too quickly

## Reflection:
- Review QQQ timing — entries were solid, exit discipline could improve
- Reinforce patience protocols on FOMC days
