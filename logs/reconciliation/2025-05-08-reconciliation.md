## 🧠 Coaching Summary

- Valid trade **idea** (fading strength via puts), but **poor execution**:
  - Entered early
  - Oversized
  - Didn’t adapt to macro tape or DP flip
- **DP + Kira + Rickman all flipped intraday** or exited losers fast.
- You held directional conviction too tightly without level-based logic.

## 🧭 Plan to Improve

1. Use **triggered levels**, not anticipation, for entries.
2. Cap sizing at 1/3 unless setup is confirmed.
3. Use a “DP Flip” alert logic: exit or hedge if sentiment turns mid-morning.
4. Always log whether a trade was **from the plan or discretionary**.
5. Rehearse trimming behavior — even if wrong, you protect P&L.
