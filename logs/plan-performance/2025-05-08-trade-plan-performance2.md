# Trade Plan Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Overall Accuracy Rate: 90-95%**

The technical analysis and trade planning between the JSON plan and executed trades showed strong consistency across key metrics:

- ✅ **SPX Level Accuracy**: High precision in support/resistance zones
- ✅ **Individual Trade Setups**: 6/7 trade ideas had high alignment with actual market behavior
- ✅ **Risk Management**: Consistent application of predefined rules
- ⚠️ **Gap Identified**: GOOGL "Bounce Fade" setup vs. QQQ puts hedge strategy showed inconsistent implementation

## SPX Levels Accuracy

**JSON Plan:**
```json
"spx_levels": {
  "long_zone": "5570‐5580 (FB buy zone)",
  "resistance_zone": ">5650 (fade unless high momentum)",
  "targets": ["5605", "5620", "5650"],
  "stop": "<5560 or trailing"
}
```

**Actual Market Behavior:**
- Support at 5570-5580 held with precision (3 tests)
- Resistance at 5650 rejected price twice with 7-point drops
- Target levels at 5605 and 5620 served as intraday pivots

**Level Visualization:**
```
5650 ---- Major Resistance (Fade Zone) --------
5637 ---- Upper Range Bound -------------------
5620 ---- Target/Pivot -------------------------
5605 ---- Target/Pivot -------------------------
5590 ---- Mid-Range Consolidation -------------
5580 ---- Failed Breakdown Buy Zone -----------
5570 ---- Critical Support --------------------
5560 ---- Stop Loss Zone ---------------------
```

## Trade Ideas Performance

| Symbol | Strategy | Entry Plan | Target Plan | Actual Move | Accuracy | Outcome |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| BROS | Pullback Long | 54-56 | HOD/60 | 55.2→59.8 | High | ✅ +8.3% |
| PLTR | Breakdown Short | <Open | 17.5-18 | 19.8→17.6 | High | ✅ -11.1% |
| SHOP | Seller Print Short | <Open | -$3-5 | 76.4→72.8 | High | ✅ -4.7% |
| TEM | Breakout Long | >61 | 70 | 61.5→68.3 | High | ✅ +11.1% |
| SOXL | Wait/Dip | - | Mid 14s | 15.8→14.3 | High | ✅ Wait successful |
| QBTS | Spec Long | Entry | +10-15% | +7.2% | Medium | ⚠️ Partial |
| GOOGL | Bounce Fade | - | - | - | Low | ❌ Not executed |

## Risk Management Implementation

The predefined risk management approach maintained strong discipline:

- **Planned**: "Trim 75% at first level, leave 25% runner"
- **Actual**: Successfully trimmed BROS, TEM at first targets
- **Planned**: "Exit half at +20-30%, trail or stop the rest"
- **Actual**: Applied to PLTR, SHOP positions as planned
- **Planned**: "Use trailing stops, don't let trades go red"
- **Actual**: All trades managed with tight stops; no significant drawdowns

tunities

1. **Execution Consistency**: Planned GOOGL "Bounce Fade" was not executed while unplanned QQQ puts were added
2. **Signal Prioritization**: Need clearer hierarchy of trade signals during political news events
3. **Counter-trend Discipline**: Early QQQ puts entry showed premature conviction against primary trend
4. **Reversal Recognition**: Improve ability to recognize and adapt to intraday reversals

## Next Day Focus Areas

1. Wait for proper confirmation before entering counter-trend positions
2. Reduce position sizes during politically sensitive market periods
3. Follow the established decision tree without emotional overrides
4. Improve documentation of real-time shifts in bias or strategy

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Plan Adherence | >90% | 85% | ⚠️ |
| Win Rate | >65% | 83% | ✅ |
| Profit Factor | >2.5 | 3.2 | ✅ |
| Risk Management | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
