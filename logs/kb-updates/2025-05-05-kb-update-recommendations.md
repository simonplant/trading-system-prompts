# KNOWLEDGE BASE UPDATE - Monday, May 5, 2025

## Positive Tags
- Proper implementation of predetermined stop losses
- Disciplined honoring of stop losses despite adverse moves
- Adaptation to changing IC signals (shifting with DP's positioning)
- Intentional risk reduction after previous session losses

## Negative Patterns
- Multiple small entries across extended timeframes (4 entries for META, multiple for NFLX)
- Mixed bias trading with conflicting IC signals (NFLX)
- Entry timing issues (NFLX entry at near daily high)
- Attempting to trade in pre-FOMC choppy conditions without specialized approach

## Rules Violated
- SOP: Position sizing consistency (multiple small entries vs. conviction-based sizing)
- Charter: Trading without clear IC confirmation on NFLX (mixed signals)

## Observed Causes
- Pre-FOMC indecision creating choppy market conditions
- Reduced conviction leading to incremental position building
- Asymmetric approach to winning trades vs. losing trades
- Conflicting signals from different IC members

## Adjustments

### Pre-FOMC Trading Protocol
- Implement 50% max position size for all trades during pre-FOMC periods
- Require 2+ technical confirmations (not just one)
- Focus on mean-reversion setups rather than breakouts
- Prefer longer-dated options (2+ weeks) to mitigate theta decay

### Entry Conviction Framework
- Tier 1 (High): 80-100% position in single entry
- Tier 2 (Medium): 50% initial + 1 scaling opportunity (25% each)
- Tier 3 (Low): 25% initial + 2 scaling opportunities
- No position should require more than 3 total entries

### Signal Consensus Framework
- Primary Signal: DP's explicit trade call
- Confirmation Signal: Second IC member OR strong technical setup
- Contradiction Protocol: When IC members contradict, default to:
  1. DP's most recent explicit position
  2. Technical structure alignment with bigger timeframe
  3. Reduced size (50% max) if entering despite contradictions

> "Less is more means exactly that, less trades and greater focus on r/r. I had quite a few mention record days, weeks or year but hope to hear it from most of you. In 30 years it always comes down to doing enough of the A plus set ups while not throwing money in the toilet in between." - DP (11:41 AM)
