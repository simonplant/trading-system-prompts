# TRADING BEHAVIORS KNOWLEDGE BASE UPDATE

## NEW PATTERNS TO DOCUMENT

### 12. Pre-FOMC Trading Protocol
- **Pattern**: Trading normal size/frequency during pre-FOMC indecision
- **Impact**: Increased stop-outs from choppy price action with diminished directional conviction
- **Fix**: Implement Pre-FOMC Protocol:
  - 50% max position size for all trades
  - Require 2+ technical confirmations (not just one)
  - Focus on mean-reversion setups vs. breakouts
  - Prefer longer-dated options (2+ weeks) to mitigate theta

### 13. Conviction-Based Position Building
- **Pattern**: Multiple small entries across extended timeframes vs. decisive positioning
- **Impact**: Commission drag, psychological fatigue, suboptimal average entry prices
- **Fix**: Entry Conviction Framework:
  - Tier 1 (High): 80-100% position in single entry
  - Tier 2 (Medium): 50% initial + 1 scaling opportunity (25% each)
  - Tier 3 (Low): 25% initial + 2 scaling opportunities
  - No position should require more than 3 total entries

## REFINEMENTS TO EXISTING PATTERNS

### Pattern #3: Gave Up Winners / Late Entries
**Current Definition**: "Missed exits on ITM positions; chased extended names"

**Recommended Refinement**:
- **Pattern**: Inconsistent approach to winning trades vs. losing trades
- **Impact**: Asymmetric exit discipline (tight stops for losses, loose for gains)
- **Fix**: Symmetric Trade Management:
  - All trades require predefined 1:2 minimum risk/reward
  - Set trailing stop to breakeven at +1R
  - Take partial profits (50%) at +1.5R
  - Trail remainder with technical stops (MAs or structure)

### Pattern #7: Mixed Bias with No Confirmation
**Current Definition**: "Traded both calls/puts on same names without clarity"

**Recommended Refinement**:
- **Pattern**: Acting on conflicting signals from different IC members
- **Impact**: Reduced conviction, unclear directional bias, hesitant execution
- **Fix**: Signal Consensus Framework:
  - Primary Signal: DP's explicit trade call
  - Confirmation Signal: Second IC member OR strong technical setup
  - Contradiction Protocol: When IC members contradict, default to:
    1. DP's most recent explicit position
    2. Technical structure alignment with bigger timeframe
    3. Reduced size (50% max) if entering despite contradictions

## NEW CONCEPTS TO INCORPORATE

### Market Regime Awareness
- Different setups work in different market regimes
- Pre-FOMC represents a specific regime requiring adjusted execution
- Identify current regime before determining valid setup types
- Each regime has specific volatility characteristics requiring position sizing adjustments

### Entry Quality vs. Entry Timing
- Perfect entry timing with poor setup quality leads to losses
- Excellent setup quality with suboptimal timing can still be profitable
- Prioritize setup quality over entry timing
- Score each entry on both dimensions: Setup Quality (A/B/C) and Entry Timing (1/2/3)

### IC Implementation Protocol
- Create structured approach for implementing IC trades
- Precise matching of expiration and strike
- Tiered sizing based on conviction signals and confirmation
- Clear criteria for exits that may differ from IC members

## IMPLEMENTATION ACTION ITEMS

1. [ ] Update the Trading Behaviors KB document with these additions
2. [ ] Create a new section on "Market Regimes" with specific protocols
3. [ ] Develop a Pre-FOMC Trading Playbook as a separate document
4. [ ] Update the daily checklist to include regime identification step
5. [ ] Review order entry technique to reduce small position building
6. [ ] Document specific criteria for trading in pre-FOMC environments
