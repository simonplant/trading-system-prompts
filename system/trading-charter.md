# TRADING SYSTEM CHARTER

## OBJECTIVE
Develop a sustainable, disciplined, and replicable trading system to profitably trade alongside Inner Circle moderators (David Prince, Adam Mancini), with real-time adaptability and capital preservation as core priorities.

---

## I. DAILY PREP ROUTINE

### 1. Morning Call Breakdown (5:15–6:00am PT)
- Extract all trade ideas from DP’s morning call
- Categorize by Confidence (High / Medium / Low), Sentiment (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral), Duration (Scalp / Day Trade / Swing)
- Cross-check Mancini’s SPX blueprint:
  - Extract top 2 actionable setups (Failed Breakdowns, Support Tests, Back-Tests)
  - Convert ES levels to SPX equivalents for options trading

### 2. Daily Focus List (Max 5 tickers)
- 1–2 Big Ideas from DP or Adam
- 2 cashflow or lotto candidates
- 1 fallback/setup name if others fail

### 3. Position Sizing Plan
- Lotto: Max $500 per idea
- Cashflow: Max $2.5K per setup
- Big Idea Swing: $5K–$10K for highest conviction
- Max total exposure: $20K intraday unless scaling from strength on green trades

### 4. Blindspot Risk Check (Required)
- No trades after 3+ strong candles unless reclaiming/backtesting
- Avoid chasing into range edges or post-move strength
- Pause if trade feels emotionally obvious

---

## II. TRADE EXECUTION RULESET

### A. Entry Filters
- Trade must match: Pattern + Level + Volume
- Confirm chart structure across 2-min / 15-min
- Only act on DP/Adam setups or your own pre-planned levels

### B. Inner Circle Style Execution

**Buy Ugly + Tier In**
- Use when DP/mods are scaling in
- Start with 1/4 size, tier by structure, max 3 tiers
- Stop: Below structure or reclaim failure

**Size Up & Trade Core**
- Use only for high-conviction ideas
- 2/3 position max
- Trim 1/3 at +15–20%, trail remainder
- Add only if price reclaims level with volume

### C. Mancini Execution Translation
- Focus on top 2 setups only:
  - Failed Breakdown → Reclaim → Buy calls
  - Back-Test → Rejection/Hold → Trade directionally
- ES→SPX translation via -30 offset
- Trade SPX 0DTE options only unless swing level is called
- Avoid ES futures until proven MES consistency

### D. Position Management
- Reassess all trades at 11:00 AM and 12:30 PM
- Do not scale into losers unless reclaim or structure confirms

### E. SPX Risk Guardrails
- Max 1 SPX position at a time
- No lotto or breakout trades near macro range edges
- No SPX trades unless level-based + DP conviction

---

## III. POST-TRADE PROCESS

### 1. End-of-Day Journal
- Log outcome, rationale, screenshots
- Confirm alignment to trade plan or note deviation

### 2. Daily Scorecard (1–5)
- Focus
- Discipline
- Sizing
- Setup quality
- System adherence

### 3. Weekly Review
- Review wins/losses by trade type
- Identify repeated blindspots
- Tag FOMO, oversize, plan violation, or revenge trades

---

## IV. RISK & CAPITAL RULES
- Max daily loss: $2,500 → stop trading
- Step away after 2 red days
- Friday = discipline day, not alpha chase
- Size increases only after two green weeks

---

## V. MINDSET & PRINCIPLES
- Capital is oxygen. Preserve it.
- Structure > Emotion. Edge > Ego.
- Wait for clean reclaims/fails, not predictions
- Mirror IC trade structure, not just direction
- Trade fewer, better: 1–2 A+ setups > 10 mediocre
- Be the most disciplined trader in the room

---

## VI. PRE-MARKET EXECUTION CHECKLIST
- DP call parsed, confidence tiers assigned
- Mancini ES setups extracted, SPX levels charted
- SPX levels loaded with TOS alerts
- Trade plan validated vs. bias and blindspots
- Focus list locked — NO trades outside the plan
