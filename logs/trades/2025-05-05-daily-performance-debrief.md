 # DAILY PERFORMANCE DEBRIEF - Monday, May 5, 2025

## MARKET CONTEXT
The markets closed mixed with significant intraday volatility after a 9-day winning streak. SPX ended at 5650.55 (-0.53%), ES at 5676.71 (-0.52%), and QQQ at 485.93 (-0.58%). Trump's surprise 100% film industry tariffs created early pressure, particularly on NFLX, while FOMC meeting anticipation led to typical pre-meeting indecision.

## TRADE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

### OVERVIEW METRICS:
- **Daily P&L**: -$615 realized
- **Open P&L**: +$95 (QQQ puts)
- **Win Rate**: 0/2 (0%)

- Current P&L: +$95
- Current Status: Following DP's scaling approach
```

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT

### STRENGTHS:
- **Risk Management**: Proper implementation of predetermined stop losses
- **IC Alignment**: Successfully followed DP's positions (META calls, QQQ puts)
- **Discipline**: Honored stop losses despite adverse moves
- **Adaptation**: Adjusted with DP's new QQQ put position

### WEAKNESSES:
- **Multiple Small Entries**: META position built with 4 small entries over 3 hours
- **Entry Timing**: NFLX entry at $14.65 came near daily high
- **Choppy Conditions**: Attempts to trade in pre-FOMC chop resulted in stop-outs

## BEHAVIORAL PATTERN DETECTION

### OBSERVED PATTERNS:
1. **Under-Trading**: Intentionally reduced size after Friday losses
2. **Mixed Bias Trading**: NFLX trade showed conflicting IC signals
3. **Technology Focus**: Both trades in tech names during sector weakness
4. **Multiple Small Entries**: Building positions incrementally rather than with conviction

### ALIGNMENT WITH KNOWN BEHAVIORS:
- **Pattern #7** (Mixed Bias with No Confirmation): NFLX trade showed conflicting signals  
- **Pattern #9** (IC Execution Drift): Varied option entry points across multiple orders
- **Pattern #3** (Gave Up Winners): Could have managed QQQ puts differently given ultimate direction

## MARKET INSIGHTS

### KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS:
- SPX failed to hold 5669.67 support level
- QQQ showed relative weakness into the close
- NFLX recovered from tariff news, invalidating bearish thesis
- META held support at 21-day moving average

### INNER CIRCLE ACTIVITY:
- DP: Started bearish (NFLX puts) but emphasized market neutrality
- Kira: Shifted between bullish and bearish positions
- Rickman: Cautious positioning with frequent trimming

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENTS:
1. **Position Sizing**: Maintain reduced sizing during FOMC week
2. **Setup Quality**: Focus on DP's "A plus set ups" as emphasized in his 11:41 AM message
3. **QQQ Position**: Continue following DP's scaling approach for May 16 puts
4. **PLTR Earnings**: Monitor response to tonight's report, particularly volatility patterns

### STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS:
1. **Pre-FOMC Protocol**: Develop specific rules for pre-meeting trading environments
2. **Entry Consolidation**: Consolidate entries to reduce overtrading and commission drag
3. **Consensus Trading**: Require clearer IC confirmation before entry
4. **Contract Assessment**: Implement pre-entry spread and premium analysis

## EMOTIONAL CHECK-IN
Today's session highlighted the challenges of trading in a choppy, pre-FOMC environment. The intentional decision to under-trade after Friday's losses was sound from a risk management perspective, though better setup identification could have produced better results.

The focus on improving the AI assistant trading system represents a valuable investment in process improvement that may yield benefits in future sessions.

## TOMORROW'S FOCUS
1. **QQQ Put Management**: Continue monitoring for additional scaling opportunities
2. **PLTR Earnings Response**: Watch for potential setups following tonight's report
3. **FOMC Preparation**: Maintain disciplined, setup-driven approach ahead of Wednesday's meeting
4. **AMD Opportunity**: Monitor DP's lotto position for potential scaling

## ACTION ITEMS
- [ ] Document specific criteria for trading in pre-FOMC environments
- [ ] Create clear protocol for builds vs. single entries based on conviction level
- [ ] Update trade setup library with refined entry criteria
- [ ] Review order entry technique to reduce small position building

*"Less is more means exactly that, less trades and greater focus on r/r. I had quite a few mention record days, weeks or year but hope to hear it from most of you. In 30 years it always comes down to doing enough of the A plus set ups while not throwing money in the toilet in between."* - DP (11:41 AM)
