# Position Significance Score Configuration
# This YAML file defines scoring rules for calculating position significance

# Scoring weights for determining position importance and visibility
score_rules:
  # Moderator alignment - multiple mods holding same position increases significance
  mod_alignment:
    multiple: 30        # Base points for multiple mods holding same position
    per_mod: 5          # Additional points per moderator beyond the first
  
  # Conviction trend - how conviction has evolved over time
  conviction_trend:
    increasing: 20      # Points for increasing conviction signals
    stable: 10          # Points for stable conviction
    decreasing: -10     # Penalty for decreasing conviction
  
  # DP reaffirmation - extra points if DP mentioned recently
  dp_reaffirmed: 
    true: 10            # Points if DP specifically mentioned position
  
  # Recent activity bonus - active management increases significance
  trimmed_or_added_in_last_24h: 15  # Points for active position management
  
  # Overnight declaration bonus - mentioned in overnight update
  declared_overnight: 10  # Points for being declared as overnight position
  
  # Age penalty - stale positions lose significance over time
  stale_days_penalty:
    - days: 1
      penalty: 0
    - days: 2
      penalty: -5
    - days: 3
      penalty: -10
    - days: 4
      penalty: -15
    - days: 5+
      penalty: -20
