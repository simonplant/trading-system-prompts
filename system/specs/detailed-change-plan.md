## ðŸ”§ Problem

The trading system had markdown logs, confusing intraday prompts, no structured ingestion of DP/moderator content, and no way to understand the difference between actual vs. optimal trades.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Convert to fully structured JSON logging
- Create human-readable renderings from JSON
- Link behavioral triggers, missed trades, and trade outcomes
- Simplify prompt surface
- Make all data queryable

---

## ðŸ§© Components

### 1. JSON Logging

| Log Type         | File Location          | Purpose                     |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Trade Log        | logs/trades/           | Capture each executed trade |
| Performance Log  | logs/performance/      | End-of-day P&L, reflections |
| Plan Performance | logs/plan-performance/ | Audit planned ideas vs. results |
| Ingested Ideas   | logs/extractions/      | DP + Moderator transcripts |
| Retrospectives   | logs/retrospectives/   | Optimized trades, deltas    |

Each must:
- Use schemas
- Include trade_id, plan_id
- Validate on save

### 2. Prompt Changes

| New Command         | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `/validate-trade`   | Sanity check behavior, sizing, plan match  |
| `/watch-trade`      | Monitor for triggering level alerts        |
| `/summarize-log`    | Render human-readable version of JSON log  |
| `/optimize-trade`   | Compare actual vs optimal, compute deltas  |
| `/missed-setup`     | Flag valid trades that were skipped        |
| `/inner-circle-ingest` | Parse and structure daily DP + mod notes |

### 3. Schemas Needed

- `trade-log.schema.json`
- `plan-performance.schema.json`
- `inner-circle.schema.json`
- `retrospective.schema.json`

Each must be versioned, enforced via `schema-validator.js`

## ðŸ§  Coaching Features

- Each trade tagged with `violations`, `notes`, `behavioral_triggers`
- KB updated via `update-trading-behaviors-kb.md`
- `/weekly-review` computes:
  - Confidence vs. PnL
  - Setup win rate
  - Violations count per week

## ðŸªœ Rollout Plan

| Day   | Action                                          |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Fri   | Finalize schemas, build summarize-log           |
| Sat   | Convert historical logs to JSON                 |
| Sun   | Refactor controller and routes                  |
| Mon   | Start logging in JSON only                      |
| Tue   | Use `/validate-trade`, `/watch-trade` live      |
| Wed   | Begin running `optimize-trade`, `missed-setup`  |
| Thu   | Ingest Inner Circle and generate full reports   |

- Automated coaching system from your own data
- Near-instant journaling
- Simplified prompt UX
