- **Weak/Transitioning**: Price between key MAs with mixed alignment
- **Moderate Downtrend**: Price below 50/100/200 SMAs but above shorter-term MAs
- **Strong Downtrend**: Price below all major MAs, with MAs aligned in descending order

## Integration Notes
- This prompt should be run before the main trading plan generation
- The MA data can be used to validate trade ideas and identify key inflection points
- All tickers showing alignment with the broader market trend should be highlighted
- Special attention should be given to tickers approaching key MAs (within 1%) as potential entries/exits

## Data Sourcing
The system should retrieve real-time premarket data and most recent daily closes from reliable financial data sources. If unable to access current data, the system should note this limitation and use the most recent available data with a clear timestamp.
