## Execution Notes

- DP reminds traders not to let a big Monday lead to careless Tuesday losses.
- Only engage if setups align. Respect levels and size accordingly.
- Mancini's system: 1–2 trades max/day. Profit lock-in at levels. Let runners work.
- FOMC tomorrow = volatile reaction risk. Avoid sizing up late today.
