# ES BLUEPRINT FOR TUESDAY, MAY 06

## MULTI-DAY TREND ANALYSIS
ES finally snapped its 9 green day streak - the longest since November 2004. This ended the "buy dips regime" that's been in place since April 6th. Monday was the "hangover" effect often seen after extended green streaks. Failed Breakdowns have been the core setup driving each leg higher during this streak, with institutions showing their hand by flushing lows, trapping shorts, then recovering key levels.

## PREVIOUS SESSION REVIEW
Monday formed an inside day, starting with overnight selling from 5698 support down to 5665. Price based at 5665 overnight, flushed to 5655 at 4:30AM, then recovered. At 10:00AM, we reclaimed 5672 triggering a long entry that rallied to 5684, then 5698, and finally to 5706 to fill the Sunday gap. Price action was choppy Mode 2 between 5665-68 and 5698 zones.

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL STRUCTURES
The red megaphone structure (containing November-March price action) was broken out of on Friday after initially failing on April 2nd. The back-test of this megaphone (5665-5672 zone) was successfully defended on Monday, keeping bulls in control. This level confluence is now a critical support zone.

## SUPPORT/RESISTANCE MAP
Macro resistance: 5796-5802 (major) - next big macro magnet
Major resistance: 5716-5720 (major), 5745 (major), 5757 (major), 5771 (major)
Minor resistance: 5673, 5685, 5692, 5698-5700, 5706, 5711
Current trading range: 5665-68 to 5698
Minor support: 5657, 5640, 5636, 5624
Major support: 5665-68 (major), 5650 (major), 5620 (major), 5600-97 (major)
Macro support: 5565 (major), 5548 (major), 5534 (major)

## NEXT SESSION GAME PLAN
Primary focus is on the 5665-68 support zone (red megaphone back-test). Rather than directly buying this support, wait for a test and recovery of 5673 (similar to Monday's 10AM setup). If 5665-68 fails, watch for a flush of overnight 5657 lows down to 5650, then a recovery of 5657 for a potential Failed Breakdown long. Below 5650, we could see a harder sell. The 5600 zone (Thursday's low) offers another potential Failed Breakdown opportunity.

## BULL/BEAR CONTROL LINES
Bull control above: 5665-68 (ideally 5673 reclaim)
Bear control below: 5650
Critical decision point: 5657 (overnight low) - failure and recovery creates Failed Breakdown

* "If we are knifing down, I'll wait and see" - avoid catching falling knives without proper Failed Breakdown structure
* "If we lose 5650, bears get their chance to sell" - don't fight a breakdown of 5650, wait for structure
* "Do not be the person knife catching every support. Give price time and wait for quality Failed Breakdowns"
* "If we are selling hard, do not be the person knife catching every support"
