# UNIFIED TRADE PLAN FOR TUESDAY, MAY 6, 2025

## MARKET BIAS:
Market sentiment is decisively bearish with futures showing DJIA -250 and NASDAQ -200 following ES breaking its 9-day green streak. DP's view aligns with Mancini's technical structure, suggesting caution as key support levels are being tested. Overall bias is bearish above 5635-38 SPX support zone, with preference for short positions if we break below this critical megaphone back-test level, but remain vigilant for potential Failed Breakdown opportunities given the extended nature of the recent pullback, especially with FOMC tomorrow at 2:30.

## 5-MINUTE PRIORITY FOCUS
- Failed Breakdown long at SPX 5643 (ES 5673) is highest probability bullish setup if support holds
- SPX 5635-38 (ES 5665-68) is critical bull/bear control zone; breakdown signals deeper selling
- FOMC tomorrow at 2:30 is key catalyst; Powell must balance slowing GDP with inflation concerns
- QQQ watch 480 (current), 475, 472 (50-day); SPY watch 555 (50-day) support level

## BIG IDEAS
1. SPX: Long on reclaim of 5643 with acceptance above level. > Target 5654, then 5668, 5676; < Add on pullbacks that hold 5635. Stop: Below 5635. [Bullish structure continuation, High conviction, Day trade, Mancini]

2. PLTR: Short below 113 (critical uptrend level). > On breakdown, target 101 (21-day); < Add on failed retests of 113. [Bearish, High conviction, Swing, DP]

## CASHFLOW TRADES
1. QQQ: Short at current 480 level with stop above yesterday's high. > Targets: 475, then 472 (50-day); < Add on failed retests of 480. [Bearish, High conviction, 1-2 day hold, DP]

2. TSLA: Buy at 260 (21-day) for bounce. > Target prior day's high; < Scale in near support. [Bullish at support, Medium conviction, 1-2 day hold, DP]

3. META: Buy at 580 (200-day) with stock or calls. > Target prior swing high; < Partial sizing at first touch. [Bullish at support, Medium conviction, 1-3 day hold, DP]

4. AMZN: Buy at 182 (21-day). > Target recent high; < Scale in near support. [Bullish at support, Medium conviction, 1-2 day hold, DP]

## LOTTO WATCH
1. SPX: Failed Breakdown of 5570 (Thursday's low minus 30) if tested. > Aggressive targets: 5590, 5620, 5635; Stop: Below 5562. [Structural reversal, Medium conviction, 0DTE, Mancini]

2. SPY: Put spread if 555 (50-day) support breaks. > Target quick move to 550; Stop: Above 557. [Bearish breakdown, Medium conviction, 0-1DTE, DP]

3. SOXL: Buy at 11 for quick bounce. > Target 12.50; Stop: Below 10.75. [Bullish bounce play, Medium conviction, 0-1DTE, DP]

IF SPX fails 5635-38         → SHORT → Targets: 5620, 5590            → Stop: 5642  
IF SPX flushes to 5620       → LONG  → Targets: 5635, 5643, 5654      → Stop: 5612  
IF SPX loses 5620            → SHORT → Targets: 5590, 5570            → Stop: 5624
