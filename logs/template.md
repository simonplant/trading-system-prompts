# DAILY TRADE LOG — [YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. TICKERS TRADED
List all tickers traded today (e.g., SPX, MSFT, NFLX):

[AAPL, SPX, QQQ, etc.]

## 2. P&L SNAPSHOT
Overall and per-ticker result (optional to include actual $$):

Total: +$X / -$X  
By ticker: SPX +$300, NFLX -$200, TSLA +$150

## 3. MARKET CONTEXT
Summarize the key market structure and drivers from today:

- Macro events (e.g. NFP, CPI)  
- SPX levels hit / missed  
- Volatility shift (VIX)  
- Relevant notes from Unified Plan

## 4. MODERATOR TRADE ACTIONS
List IC trades you tracked, followed, or ignored. Be specific.

- DP added NFLX puts at 10:12am at $610; I did not take it  
- DP sold META near HOD — I caught the exit 5 mins later  
- Adam's SPX 5606 reclaim worked — I missed the entry

## 5. TRADES EXECUTED
Repeat the structure below for each trade:

### [TICKER] / [CALL or PUT or STOCK] / [LONG or SHORT]  
- Entry: [Time, Price]  
- Exit: [Time, Price]  
- Size: [Quantity or $ Risked]  
- Outcome: [+/- $ or %]  
- Setup Type: [Big Idea, Cashflow, Lotto, Unplanned]  
- Source: [DP, Mancini, Plan, Unplanned]  
- Alignment: [In Plan, Off-Plan, Reactive, Blind Spot]  
- Notes: [Emotion, hesitation, mod influence, FOMO, etc.]

## 6. INTRADAY NOTES + EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS
Bullet points of emotional surges, uncertainty, mistakes:

- Chased SPX call after it ran 15 points → stopped out  
- Hesitated on MSFT long despite clean reclaim — confidence issue  
- Didn't trust the plan after first red trade

## 7. LESSONS + ACTION PLAN
Write 2–3 bullet points to guide future decisions:

- No more buying into resistance unless reclaim confirmed  
- Respect plan size — avoid jumping to full size out of FOMO  
- When DP sizes up — don’t fade the trade, follow with structure

## 8. BLIND SPOT CHECK
Did I violate any known blind spots?

☐ Chased strength?  
☐ Traded during chop zone?  
☐ Ignored pre-staged plan?  
☐ Overtraded after red?  
☐ Emotional revenge trade?  
☐ Held lotto too long?
