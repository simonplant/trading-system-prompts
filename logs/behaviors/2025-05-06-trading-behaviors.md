- improvement-after-reset (midday refocus)

## Review Summary
Began trading day emotionally reactive due to delays in system prep. Entered a 0DTE QQQ put too early. Loss was limited to $600. Recovered focus. Good alignment with mod entries and consolidation. Avoided revenge trading. Trimmed 5/7 positions well.
