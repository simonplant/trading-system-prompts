# PERFORMANCE DEBRIEF – Tuesday, May 6, 2025

## Market Summary
SPX: 5624  
QQQ: 483  
VIX: 14.9  
Tone: headline driven, macro tension pre-FOMC

## Positions Summary
- PLTR puts: full exit, stopped after mod exits
- QQQ 478P (5/6): expired worthless, -$600
- QQQ 480/482P (5/7): trimmed winners, holding rest
- QQQ 475/480P (5/16): intact swing core short

## Execution Quality
- PLTR entry was aligned, but early
- 478P entry was reactionary
- 5/7 trims were solid
- 5/16 strikes consolidated well after DP and Rick alerts

## Trade Grades
- PLTR: B- (entry good, exit disciplined)
- 478P: D (chased momentum without structure)
- 5/7 QQQs: B+ (solid trim logic)
- 5/16 QQQs: A- (good mod alignment)

## Missed Setups
- PLTR 110C lotto: saw it, didn’t execute due to directional bias conflict

## PnL Attribution
- PLTR: -219  
- 478P: -600  
- 5/7 QQQs: +280 realized  
- 5/16 QQQs: marked flat-to-slight drawdown

## Next-Day Hypothesis
Market will compress ahead of FOMC. First 90 minutes choppy. Watch for ES failure of 5620 as risk-on/risk-off toggle.

## Intent vs Outcome Scoring
- Intent to follow mod trades: 9/10  
- Outcome: 7/10  
- Execution timing: 6/10  
- Sizing discipline: 6.5/10
