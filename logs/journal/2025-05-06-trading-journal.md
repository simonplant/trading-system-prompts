### Emotional Check-In
Started with frustration waiting for trade system boot-up, led to undisciplined early trade. Managed to contain losses, shifted to moderation. Avoided chasing after mid-morning. Overall behavior improved after initial errors.

---

### Tomorrow’s Intention

**INTENTION:** Avoid early impulsive trades. Wait for clean structure post-FOMC. No more than 3 entries max. Start small, add only if aligned with structure + mods.
