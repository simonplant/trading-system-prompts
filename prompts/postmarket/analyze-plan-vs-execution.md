## ‚úÖ TASKS

1. **Match planned trades** (ticker, direction, trigger, setup) against actual trades.
2. **Compare execution** vs. both DP‚Äôs stated intentions and Mancini‚Äôs plan and trades.
3. **Score each trade** for alignment (0‚Äì10), with commentary:
   - ‚úÖ Perfect match
   - ‚ùå Missed planned setup
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Unplanned trade or misaligned size/direction
4. **Identify missed opportunities** in dollar terms (especially Mancini setups).
5. **Output** reconciliation report as markdown for /logs/reconciliation/{{date}}-analysis.md.

## üß† RECONCILIATION LOGIC

### Setup Alignment Categories

- `perfect`: Executed as planned with proper size and trim
- `partial`: Taken but mistimed entry or exits
- `missed`: Setup triggered but not traded
- `emotional`: Trade outside of plan, size not justified

### Mancini ES Setup Evaluation

- Match plan setup: e.g., ‚ÄúFailed Breakdown of 5607‚Äù
- Confirm entry trigger (ES levels or SPX equivalent)
- Track trim levels and profit-taking behavior
- Calculate profit at $50/point per contract
- Score opportunity capture vs. plan

## MANCINI TRADE REVIEW

### Pre-FOMC Setup: Failed Breakdown 5607
- Entry: 5614
- Trims: 5635, 5650
- Runner: 5689
- Max Profit: ~$3,750/contract
- Alignment: ‚ùå Not taken

### FOMC Reaction Setup: FB 5611
- Entry: 5611
- Trims: 5620 ‚Üí 5635
- Outcome: ~24 pts, $1,200/contract
- Alignment: ‚ùå Not taken

---

## MISSED OPPORTUNITY SUMMARY

- Missed ~$3,750 potential on FB of 5607 (per contract)
- Would translate to 5-10x on SPX options if converted

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

- Adherence to DP‚Äôs macro guidance ‚úÖ
- Missed Mancini‚Äôs top setup ‚ùå
- Post-FOMC execution was emotionally stable, tactical
- Improve speed of translation from Mancini levels to SPX options
