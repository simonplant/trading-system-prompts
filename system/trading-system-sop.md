# TRADING SYSTEM SOP — SIMON PLANT

## I. DAILY WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### 1. PREMARKET ROUTINE (5:00–6:30 AM PT)
- Parse DP morning call → extract trade ideas
- Parse Mancini’s ES Blueprint → convert top 2 setups to SPX
- Update ThinkOrSwim alerts for key SPX/QQQ levels
- Tag all trade ideas by: Confidence, Sentiment, Duration
- Generate Unified Trade Plan for the day

### 2. MORNING EXECUTION (6:30–9:00 AM PT)
- Focus on BIG IDEAS and CASHFLOW setups
- Execute only trades that match: Setup + Trigger + Level
- Use preset sizing rules:
  - Lotto: Max $500
  - Cashflow: $1–2.5K
  - Big Idea: $5–10K

### 3. MIDDAY REVIEW (11:00 AM + 12:30 PM PT)
- Reassess all open trades:
  - Trim or exit if reversal patterns form
  - Cut losers below structure or VWAP
- No new trades unless:
  - Fresh reclaim/back-test setup appears
  - Macro catalyst hits

### 4. AFTERNOON RULES (After 1:00 PM PT)
- No new positions
- Manage open trades only
- Avoid lotto trades into close unless pre-confirmed plan

## II. SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### TRADE PLAN STRUCTURE
- Big Ideas: Highest conviction, double position allowed
- Cashflow: Intraday trades with clean levels + tape confirmation
- Lotto Watch: 0DTE only, well-structured entries near defined risk

### POSITION SIZING FRAMEWORK
- Tier 1 (Big Idea): $5–10K
- Tier 2 (Cashflow): $1–2.5K
- Tier 3 (Lotto): Max $500
- Max exposure: $20K intraday

### TECHNICAL CHECKLIST
- Structure: Reclaim, fail, or back-test entry
- Trigger: Confirmation on 2m / 15m chart
- Level: Alignment with planned SPX/QQQ zone
- Volume: Surge at inflection adds confidence

## III. DAILY ACCOUNTABILITY

### END-OF-DAY REVIEW
- Log all trades with:
  - Setup name
  - Entry/exit levels
  - SPX context
  - Execution score (A/B/C)
  - Emotion tag (Calm / Chase / Revenge / Fear)

### WEEKLY REFLECTION
- Top 3 wins and why they worked
- Top 3 losses and root cause
- Setup quality score: A/B/C
- Execution quality score: A/B/C
- Adjust blindspots list if new patterns appear

---

## IV. RISK AND BEHAVIORAL GUARDRAILS

- Stop trading for the day if:
  - Max loss = $2,500
  - 2 red days in a row
- Never trade without a level + trigger + stop
- No new trades after 1:00 PM
- Cap daily trades at 10 total
- No more than 1 SPX position open at once
- Use 0DTE for intraday SPX; next-week for swings

---

## V. MINDSET + EXECUTION PRINCIPLES

- Follow structure, not feelings
- Discipline > Prediction
- Adapt bias to the tape — don't fight momentum
- Don’t trade if plan not loaded
- Focus on 2–3 high-quality setups, not dozens of low-probability ones
- Trade like a professional allocator, not a gambler
