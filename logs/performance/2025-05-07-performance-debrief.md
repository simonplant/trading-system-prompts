# Performance Debrief — 2025-05-07

## P&L Summary
- **Premarket P/L**: -$2,000 (early drawdown)
- **EOD P/L**: +$640.50 realized, -$654.30 unrealized
- **Net Realized Recovery**: +$2,640.50

## Key Trades
- **QQQ 480P (0DTE)**: Sold into strength after morning drawdown. Strong recovery, correct trim strategy.
- **QQQ 475P (5/8 expiry)**: Re-entered with small size late-day. Open risk aligned with Powell + headline volatility.

## Execution Score
- **Plan Alignment**: 9.5/10 – waited for post-FOMC setup, followed level-to-level protocol
- **Risk Control**: 10/10 – avoided early traps, recovered without revenge trading
- **Trade Selection**: 8/10 – QQQ timing solid, execution of trims could be longer held
- **Behavioral Mastery**: 9/10 – Full recovery from stress position, exercised restraint

## Strategy Notes
- DP: “Should be very short going into this [Powell conf]... every Trump headline is now a short”
- Position: 3x QQQ 475P (5/8) held overnight aligns with DP’s bearish bias
- Macro Setup: Elevated headline risk (Trump, Powell, geopolitics), low VIX, extended tape = ripe for downside headline traps

## Takeaways
- ✅ Excellent patience through first half of FOMC day
- ✅ Took clear opportunity with defined risk
- ✅ Finished green on realized after deep premarket red
- ❗Could have held 0DTE winners longer, review trim strategy

## Grade: **A-**

## Next Steps:
- Monitor QQQ 5/8 475P overnight swing carefully (news-driven setup)
- Tighten stop protocol for small size overnight swings
- Prep early for headline-driven volatility cycle
