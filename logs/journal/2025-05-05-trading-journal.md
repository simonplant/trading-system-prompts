### üîç Lessons + Adjustments

**What's Working:**
- Risk management discipline (honoring predetermined stops)
- Adaptation to IC signals (shifting with DP's positioning)
- Intentional position sizing reduction during volatile conditions
- Use of technical levels to define entry/exit points

**What to Avoid:**
- Multiple small entries across extended timeframes
- Trading in pre-FOMC chop without specialized approach
- Mixed bias trading with conflicting IC signals
- High entries at extended price levels

**Behavior Rating (1-5):** 3 - Disciplined stops but poor entry execution and timing

**Edge Score (1-5):** 2 - Limited edge in choppy pre-FOMC environment

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Pre-FOMC Trading Protocol (50% max size, 2+ confirmations)
2. Develop Entry Conviction Framework (tiered position building)
3. Create Signal Consensus Framework to handle conflicting IC signals
4. Continue with QQQ put management following DP's approach
5. Monitor PLTR earnings response for potential setups

### Emotional Check-In
Today's session highlighted the challenges of trading in a choppy, pre-FOMC environment. The decision to reduce position sizing after Friday's losses was sound risk management, though setup quality and entry execution could have been better.

The focus on improving the AI assistant trading system represents a valuable process investment that should yield future benefits. Emotionally balanced despite the losses, with clear awareness of behavioral patterns that need adjustment.

### Tomorrow's Intention

**INTENTION:** Trade only A+ setups with proper entry conviction sizing - no more than 3 entries per position.
