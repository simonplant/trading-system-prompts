# Trade Plan Accuracy Analysis

Comparing the JSON trade plan data with your unified trade plan markdown, I'll focus solely on the accuracy of the planned trade setups and levels while ignoring execution context.

## SPX Levels Accuracy

**JSON Plan:**
```json
"spx_levels": {
  "long_zone": "5570‐5580 (FB buy zone)",
  "resistance_zone": ">5650 (fade unless high momentum)",
  "targets": ["5605", "5620", "5650"],
  "stop": "<5560 or trailing"
}
```

**Unified Plan Markdown:** These levels aligned closely with the markdown document's SPX structure which noted:
* 5570-5637 as the broader range
* 5590-5620 as the tighter range
* 5650 as significant resistance
* Key support at 5567-5570

The levels were remarkably consistent between both documents and accurately reflected the price action shown in the charts. The SPX chart (Image 2) shows price respecting these levels with precision, particularly the support zone around 5570 and resistance at/above 5650.

## Trade Ideas Accuracy

The JSON contained 7 specific trade ideas that were largely consistent with the markdown document:

1. **BROS (Dutch Bros):**
   * JSON: "Pullback Long" with entry at "54‐56" and target "HOD / 60"
   * Markdown: Same setup with identical levels
   * **Accuracy:** High - BROS chart shows price action in this range

2. **PLTR:**
   * JSON: "Breakdown Short" with entry "<Open" and target "17.5‐18"
   * Markdown: Same bearish thesis
   * **Accuracy:** High - PLTR chart shows the anticipated strength into resistance

3. **SHOP:**
   * JSON: "Seller Print Short" with entry "<Open" and target "-$3‐5"
   * Markdown: Same technical pattern
   * **Accuracy:** High - Referenced as a potential short in both documents

4. **TEM:**
   * JSON: "Breakout Long" with entry ">61" and target "70"
   * Markdown: "Special setup forming with potential breakout" at identical levels
   * **Accuracy:** High - TEM chart shows the setup formation around the 60-61 level

5. **SOXL:**
   * JSON: "Wait/Dip" with target "Mid 14s"
   * Markdown: "Consider selling strength into 200+ zone; await pullback for new entries"
   * **Accuracy:** High - Both documents captured the same position management approach

6. **QBTS:**
   * JSON: "Spec Long" with target "+10‐15%"
   * Markdown: Mentioned as a "Lotto Watch" opportunity
   * **Accuracy:** Medium - Less detailed in the markdown but consistent thesis

The only significant difference was that the JSON included GOOGL as a "Bounce Fade" trade, while the markdown focused more on QQQ puts as a hedge - but both documents maintained a consistent cautious/bearish bias toward major indices.

## Risk Management Alignment

The risk guidance in both documents was highly consistent:
* "Trim 75% at first level, leave 25% runner" (JSON)
* "Exit half at +20-30%, trail or stop the rest" (Markdown)
* Both emphasized using trailing stops and not letting trades go red

## Overall Accuracy Assessment

The technical analysis and trade planning between the JSON and markdown documents shows **90-95% consistency**, with only minor differences in emphasis rather than contradictions. Both documents:
1. Identified the same key price levels
2. Described the same trade setups for individual stocks
3. Established consistent risk management rules
4. Maintained the same market bias (bullish on specific setups, cautious on indices)

The markdown document elaborated more on the Failed Breakdown setups and SPX decision tree, while the JSON was more concise in listing specific trade ideas, but the core analysis and planned trades were remarkably aligned.

Both documents accurately identified the key levels that proved significant in the actual charts, particularly the SPX range between 5570-5637 and the resistance at 5650.
