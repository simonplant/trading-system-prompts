# ✍️ Trading Journal – 2025-05-08

## Morning Intentions
- Focused on failed breakdowns and fading spikes
- Planned SPX zone long or put entries >5650
- Watch $PLTR puts, $BROS dip buys, $SHOP short

## What Happened
- Entered QQQ puts early without confirmation
- Ignored DP’s intraday reversal to long $QQQ
- Held directional conviction into political tape

## Emotional Landscape
- Frustration at Trump’s statement
- Couldn’t flip or pivot
- Felt FOMO at moderator reversals

## What I Learned
- No confirmation = no trade
- Emotional tape = smaller size, faster exits
- If DP reverses and I don’t, I must reduce risk
